<p>Tis the season for updated privacy notifications, as websites scramble to comply with the European Union&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>), which goes into effect May 25th, 2018. Since the regulation applies to any entity processing the personal data of EU citizens, ignoring it really isn&#8217;t a good option. Upgrading to ExpressionEngine v4.3 is.</p>

<p>ExpressionEngine v4.3 brings a comprehensive set of tools that make it the go-to CMS for building sites that take user privacy concerns seriously. It handles the heavy lifting, making it easy for designers and third party developers to create <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliant websites.</p>

<h2>Consent Manager</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> is all about transparency and the need to obtain consent before processing personal data.  The new Consent Manager allows users to create and manage any requests for consent that they may need.  Have a Terms of Service? Create a consent request for it. Offering email sign-ups? Consent request.  Want to use targeted ad tracking? You know what you need to do.</p>

<p>The consent manager even lets you manage consent requests you didn&#8217;t know you needed. Native consent requests are automatically created and third party add-ons that may require consent can create their own consent requests upon installation or update.</p>

<p>On the frontend, users can easily view all existing consent requests, give or deny consent, and modify their consent settings at any time.  <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/templates/globals/consent.html">Global consent variables</a> make it simple to alter content based on a user&#8217;s consent to a given request:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;if consent:ee_mail:email_collection&#125;

    &#123;sign_up_button&#125;

&#123;/if&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>All of those user responses to the consent requests are maintained in an <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/cp/logs/consent.html">audit log</a>, making it a simple matter to report a user&#8217;s consent history. Because when dealing with the law, it&#8217;s always best to cover your &#8230; bases.</p>

<h2>Cookie Consent</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>&#8217;s discussion of cookies is sparse, but we&#8217;ve jumped through hoops before <a href="https://expressionengine.com/blog/the-cookie-consent-module-eu-cookie-legislation">due to EU cookie regulations</a>, so we&#8217;ve built in native cookie consent functionality that will stand up to the strictest interpretations of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> on cookies.</p>

<p>If you enable the cookie consent requirement in the <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/cp/settings/security-privacy.html#require-user-consent-to-set-cookies">cookie settings</a>, only <strong>strictly necessary cookies</strong> will be set natively without first obtaining explicit prior consent.  Native ExpressionEngine cookies are <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/general/cookies.html">well documented</a>, and necessary cookies do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (<abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr>).</p>

<p>Consent to set non-necessary cookies can be managed via the Consent Manager, just like any other consent request.  Third party add-ons can register cookies they set as well. Any non-necessary cookie that is set via internal ExpressionEngine methods will require user consent prior to being set.</p>

<h2>Member Anonymization</h2>

<p>In addition to making certain users know what data a site is collecting and requiring permission for any <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> data, the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> requires that users be able to remove their personal data at will.  In many cases, this is simply a matter of deleting the member, which is already an option. But there are times when a record needs to be maintained, such as purchase records.</p>

<p>If deleting all traces of a member isn&#8217;t viable, version 4.3 allows you to &#8216;Anonymize&#8217; an existing user, wiping out all <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> data but still maintaining the non-identifiable elements for the record.  To anonymize a member&#8217;s record, visit the Member&#8217;s profile in the control panel, and click &#8220;Anonymize Member Record&#8221;.</p>

<p>Third party developers can sanitize any data they have stored as well via the new extension hooks.</p>

<h2>Extension Hooks You Say?</h2>

<p>Yes, one goal in v4.3 is to make it as easy as possible for third party developers to make their add-ons <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> friendly.</p>

<p>The add-on has its own cookies?  Put them in <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/development/addon_setup_php_file.html">addon.addon.setup.php file</a>. Need to collect personal data? Add a few more lines to <code>addon.setup.php</code>.  The native <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/add-ons/consent/index.html">Consent module</a> will handle users granting and denying consent for all registered consent requests, both first and third party.</p>

<p>If your add-on needs to check those permissions before performing an action, the <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/development/services/consent.html">Consent service</a> makes it easy. And the new <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/development/extension_hooks/model/member/index.html#member-anonymize">member_anonymization hook</a> lets you know if you need to nuke any <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> your add-on stores!</p>

<h2>Breach Notification</h2>

<p>Continuing the focus on transparency, the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> details specific requirements concerning the notification of the subjects of a data breach. The new <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4//cp/utilities/mass-notification-export.html">Mass Notification Export</a> utility will output both a full and a validated CSV of member email addresses. That makes it fast and easy to export to a third-party validation and mass notification service to make sure your emails are delivered and your domain doesn&#8217;t get blacklisted for spam. It&#8217;s one less thing to worry about in the unlikely event data is compromised.</p>

<h2>Don&#8217;t care about the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>?</h2>

<p>Totally unaffected by the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>? Celebrate your good fortune by checking out the new filters on the entry manager. Filter by author or set parameters on where to search while laughing at the rest of us as we try to figure out what counts as &#8216;Personally Identifying Information&#8217;.</p>

<p>The European Union&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>), a sprawling set of regulations designed with the intent on protecting privacy rights, becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018. You&#8217;ve seen the emails, the blog posts, and probably have made changes to your own site (or are still wondering what to do). Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated our own <a href="https://ellislab.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://ellislab.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> to verify compliance with the new&nbsp;regulations</li>
<li>Taken an inventory of all places we collect and/or process Personally Identifiable Information (<abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr>), and verified that those are also in compliance</li>
<li>Added opt-in to our optional cookies, and documented them thoroughly in our new <a href="https://ellislab.com/cookies-policy">Cookies Policy</a></li>
<li>Spent the past few months building tools to make it easier for you to build <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>-compliant&nbsp;websites</li>
</ul>

<p>ExpressionEngine, for its part, has always been compliant out-of-the-box. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Its cookies contain no <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> (with the exception of a couple comment module cookies that are compliant because they are opt-in only, their purpose is clear, and consent is easily withdrawn by the user).</li>
<li>the <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> stored for registered members is clearly visible and modifiable in the control panel.</li>
<li>Its templating has the flexibility to output <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> in any format necessary for verification or&nbsp;portability.</li>
<li>Member records and their <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> can be easily deleted. There&#8217;s even an optional self-service delete method available for membership sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>But that&#8217;s only part of the story. As a site builder and operator, what you do with <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> is in your hands. And you must be capable of responding to specific <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> requests. For many web sites, and the folks who build them, making sure that you&#8217;re operating in a compliant way can be difficult and take a lot of time. If you&#8217;re a company or developer already on a tight budget, it&#8217;s a pain, and a burden of time and money you have to buy from somewhere else.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve felt frustrated, wondering if these unproven regulations will actually improve things, you&#8217;re not alone. Already the companies that can afford it—arguably the ones for whom these laws are directed—are taking measures to minimize their exposure. Others are simply preventing EU visitors from using their sites, and forbidding their use in their terms of service. That approach doesn&#8217;t do anyone any good. Ultimately, time will tell, and only after the laws have been litigated and proven in the courts will we know if it&#8217;s working, or even how some of the regulations will be interpreted and enforced.</p>

<p>In the mean time, we like to obey the laws of the land and are sure you do too. And it&#8217;s always nice when that&#8217;s easy to do. It&#8217;s your responsibility, but we feel we should do more than tell you that you&#8217;re on your own. Or leave you to wade into MySQL to comply with an esoteric request. So we are committed to making ExpressionEngine the easiest CMS to comply with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and similar regulations revolving around user privacy. Including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gaining clear consent, and building application logic around the user&#8217;s consents</li>
<li>Enabling you to respond to a person&#8217;s right to be forgotten without obliterating or orphaning records that you need to keep</li>
<li>Enabling you to notify people easily in the unfortunate event of a data breach</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick example: the consent tools we&#8217;ve built for you. Some features of your site process <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr>, and that requires specific and clear consent, that can be easily withdrawn. We have built a new module with simple tags that will let you capture consent for anything you need, and honor the user&#8217;s wishes throughout your site. It&#8217;s what we&#8217;re using right now on our site and will soon be available for you too. For example, if you require cookie consent, before adding Google Analytics&#8217; script, you can check to see if the user allows you to set &#8220;performance&#8221; cookies:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;if consent:ee:cookies_performance&#125;
    &lt;!-- Google Analytics --&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m)&#123;i&#91;'GoogleAnalyticsObject'&#93;=r;i&#91;r&#93;=i&#91;r&#93;||function()&#123;
    (i&#91;r&#93;.q=i&#91;r&#93;.q||&#91;&#93;).push(arguments)&#125;,i&#91;r&#93;.l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)&#91;0&#93;;a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
    &#125;)(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

    ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
    ga('send', 'pageview');
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- End Google Analytics --&gt;
&#123;/if&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, and we&#8217;ll be blogging and posting educational tips and tricks on using these new features as time goes on. Thanks for sticking to the end of this read. It was a small wall of text, and still less than 1% of the length of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>. It&#8217;s our aim to help keep building on the web fun, even in the face of 55,000+ words of new regulations that aren&#8217;t easily digestible for most professionals.</p>

<p>If ExpressionEngine 2 was a freight train, ExpressionEngine 4 is a bullet train. We&#8217;re moving faster than ever before, streamlining, and improving the software with every new release.</p>

<p>Speaking of new releases&#8230;</p>

<h2>Editing 2.0.</h2>

<p>In our last release we re-introduced an improved bulk editing feature. Today we take that one step further.</p>

<p>Starting in ExpressionEngine 4.2 you can select multiple entries, and edit them individually, in order within a single UI. Gone are the days of opening entries in new windows/tabs to make precision edits.</p>

<p>Along with Bulk Edit, this new feature makes editing your content in ExpressionEngine more efficient and smoother than ever before!</p>

<figure>

<h2>Fluid meta variables</h2>

<p>We introduced Fluid in version 4.0. This brand new field type puts the power of content layout into your client&#8217;s hands, without needing a degree in Computer Science.</p>

<p>Today we expand this terrific new field, bringing Fluid meta variables to the fray.</p>

<p>With Fluid meta variables you can get all conditional up in the templates, increasing the parsing power of Fluid ten-fold!</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;fluid_content&#125;
    &lt;div &#123;if fluid_content:first&#125;class="well"&#123;/if&#125;&gt;

        &#123;fluid_content:text&#125;
            &#123;if &#123;fluid_content:first name="text"&#125;&#125;
                &lt;div class="lead"&gt;&#123;content&#125;&lt;/div&gt;
            &#123;if:else&#125;
                &#123;content&#125;
            &#123;/if&#125;
        &#123;/fluid_content:text&#125;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&#123;/fluid_content&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now you can separate the first item from the rest, and so much more! Check out the <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/fieldtypes/fluid.html#variables" rel="external">documentation for Fluid meta variables</a>.</p>

<h2>Variable Dates</h2>

<p>Typically when we refer to time it&#8217;s relative to our present. We say Tomorrow, Yesterday, Next Week. Starting <em>today</em>, you can have ExpressionEngine be a little more conversational in its date output.</p>

<p>For instance if we wanted to know how much time is left until <a href="https://www.eeconf.com" rel="external">EE CONF 2018</a> we could write</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>EE CONF 2018 starts &#123;variable_time:relative date='2018-10-25' units='days'&#125;.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which would output &#8220;EE CONF 2018 starts in 191 days.&#8221;</p>

<p>ExpressionEngine 4.2 can even output specific dates from relative input.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;variable_time date="2 days ago" format="%F %d, %Y"&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Outputs &#8220;April 09, 2018&#8221;</p>

<p>Neat! And there&#8217;s a ton of <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/templates/date_variable_formatting.html#relative-dates" rel="external">applications for variable dates</a>.</p>

<h2>What else is there?</h2>

<p>Along with the major improvements above, we bring a gaggle of security, stability and UI fixes to ExpressionEngine. These changes include smoother upgrade checks; an easier way to see what&#8217;s selected in the Drop Down UI; and better system notifications.</p>

<p>Oh, and you can now create new relationship entries right from the Publish Form, no big deal.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://expressionengine.com/asset/img/blog/new-relationships.gif" alt="Inline Relationship Creation">
</figure>

<p>ExpressionEngine 4.2 brings a load of improvements, enhancements, and fun to building projects for yourself and your clients. Want to get all that good stuff? It&#8217;s just a click away!</p>

<p>Next Stop? Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a fact. ExpressionEngine CMS continually improves. With every new release we squash bugs, enhance security, and add more value. Today we&#8217;re proud to release version 4.1 packed with a bevy of fixes, enhancements, and improvements. Another fact. All this greatness is available in a single click.</p>

<h2>A preview of things to come</h2>

<p>For a long time ExpressionEngine CMS has had a &#8220;Live Look&#8221; feature which allowed content editors to see what their entries would look like within the design of their site&#8217;s templates. A powerful and convenient feature. But, like all things it could be improved.</p>

<p>In 4.1 we introduce Live Preview. Now content editors can preview their content in context, while they&#8217;re editing it. No special statuses or extra templates needed. Live Preview is responsive and works beautifully across all kinds of devices.</p>

<p>We believe that both you and your clients are going to LOVE Live Preview!</p>

<h2>Making changes en masse</h2>

<p>Today we welcome back an improved Bulk Edit feature. In 4.1 you will be able to select multiple entries and quickly edit their categories, dates, statuses, and more. You can add or remove categories from your entries with a single save. Starting today you can open or close a group of entries in seconds, without a single extra browser tab!</p>

<p>Bulk Edit is the first step towards more robust content editing in ExpressionEngine. We believe Bulk Edit is a huge quality-of-life feature, and we hope you find it as useful as we do.</p>

<h2>There&#8217;s always more&#8230;</h2>

<p>4.1 has a variety of additional smaller, but not less important enhancements as well. Including improved security and notifications for password and email changes; dozens of bug fixes, and UI tweaks; and iterations on our variable modifiers, like the new decimal parameter for our currency modifier. For example <code>{cost:currency decimal='0'}</code> would output <code>$299</code> instead of <code>$299.00</code></p>

				<p>Dates are not the only way we measure or describe time. Take a movie theater&#8217;s web site. The date and time that a show starts is important. But so is its length.

<figure><img src="https://expressionengine.com/asset/img/blog/duration-fieldtype.gif" alt="Duration fieldtype example"></figure>

<p>Both the input and the output options are flexible. In the example of our movie above, &#8220;The Jungle Book&#8221;, the site builder has created a Duration field with minutes as the unit of measure. The content author can enter the runtime as 106 minutes or use colon notation of 1:46, indicating 1 hour and 46 minutes. Either way, ExpressionEngine knows the total time being indicated, and the site builder could display it as:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;runtime&#125;
&#123;!-- 1:46 --&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or have full control over the formatting with the <code>format=</code> parameter like:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;runtime format='%h hr, %m min'&#125;
&#123;!-- 1 hr, 46 min --&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the field&#8217;s settings, the site builder can select either hours, minutes, or seconds as the unit of time. ExpressionEngine will cue the author in the placeholder text, so they are aware of what their input would signify. e.g. 42 hours vs. 42 minutes vs. 42 seconds. Movie and play runtimes, cooking times, travel times, cycling / running elapsed times, and more are all great fits for the new Duration fieldtype.</p>

				<p>We&#8217;ve been sharing some of ExpressionEngine&#8217;s big new features on our blog lately. But ExpressionEngine 4 also comes packed with little treats that increase your web site&#8217;s flexibility and make building sites even easier. Here are three new content filters that you can start using today!</p>

<h2><code>show_expired='only'</code></h2>

<p>Expiration dates are a great way to automate removal of content from your site at a specified time. (Pizza joints, I&#8217;m looking at you and your &#8220;current specials&#8221; that expired in fall of 2017&#8230;) Whether it&#8217;s a concert, a limited time offer, or an annual funding drive, expiration dates can ensure that your web site doesn&#8217;t contain stale content. And your content authors don&#8217;t have to set reminders and alarms and wake up at 2am to close entries.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s say that you want to explicitly show expired content in an archive listing. Easy enough, <code>show_expired='yes'</code>. Ah, but things aren&#8217;t always so simple are they? Take this example of a City Events channel:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Event</th>
  <th>Entry Date</th>
  <th>Expiration Date</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>First Friday Art Walk</td>
  <td>2/02/2018 5:30pm</td>
  <td>2/02/2018 10:00pm</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Local Pour Craft Beverage Tours</td>
  <td>2/15/2018 1:30pm</td>
  <td>2/15/2018 5:00pm</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Winterfest</td>
  <td>2/15/2018 6:00pm</td>
  <td>2/18/2018 9:00pm</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><code>show_expired='yes'</code> works <em>mostly</em>:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='events' show_expired='yes'&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this opening tag, a visitor to the archive on February 9th would see the previous weekend&#8217;s event, <strong>First Friday Art Walk</strong>.</p>

<p>But what about someone visiting the site on <em>February 17th</em>, in the middle of Winterfest? Winterfest is an open entry, dated two days ago, so it would show up too. But that&#8217;s not our intent. We don&#8217;t want a visitor in town on Saturday to think that Winterfest is over!</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='events' show_expired='only'&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This new filter matches our intent. <strong>Only</strong> show events that have expired. On February 17th, that means <strong>First Friday Art Walk</strong> and <strong>Local Pour Craft Beverage Tours</strong> will be listed in our archive of past events, but not <strong>Winterfest</strong>, which isn&#8217;t over yet. At 9pm on Sunday the 18th, Winterfest will automatically be included as a past event.</p>

<h2><code>sticky='only'</code></h2>

<p>Sticky entries ignore the sort order of your Channel Entries tag and are always listed first. This can be handy for important announcements, for keeping hot news stories on the front page, or for descriptive content that you always want visitors to see first.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a variable number of &#8220;hot&#8221; news items. Some days it&#8217;s ten stories, on a slow news day there are only two. You want to make a link so your regular visitors can jump straight to the hot stories. In ExpressionEngine, you always have many options for implementation, each with subtle differences in behavior.</p>

<p>For example, you could use a &#8220;Featured&#8221; status and filter based on that. But statuses don&#8217;t affect the sort order, so to keep them at the top, you&#8217;d have to use a separate Channel Entries tag. That&#8217;s okay, but if the number of articles is variable and you&#8217;ve got a complex layout, it can get tricky.</p>

<p>Sticky is perfect in this case, but previously you&#8217;d have to &#8220;cut&#8221; the listings using <code>limit=''</code>, which means placing that same limitation on your content authors. <code>limit='5'</code>, instruct them to just pick 5 stories, no more no less, and their &#8220;hot stories&#8221; are fine. But if they pick more than 5, then the excess won&#8217;t show up. If they pick fewer than 5, then normal stories get included with the &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.</p>

<p>With this new filter:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='news' sticky='only'&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now you can create a listing that <em>only</em> contains your must-read content, without setting limits on your content authors.</p>

<h2><code>search:numeric_field=''</code></h2>

<p>The last new unsung parametric hero of ExpressionEngine 4 is an update to the venerable <code>search:field=''</code> parameter. For numeric fields, you&#8217;ve always been able to use basic comparison operators. To show items that are $10 or less: <code>search:price='&lt;=10'</code>. ExpressionEngine 4 expands on this by allowing you to specify <em>ranges</em>.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;!-- show me Middle Schoolers --&#125;
&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='students' search:grade='&gt;5|&lt;9'&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now the filter will show all students from grades 6, 7, and 8.</p>

<p>This also works for <em>custom date fields</em>. Since date fields are stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>, you can perform numeric range checks just as easily.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;!-- show everyone who signed up to take their ACT from February through April 2018 --&#125;
&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='students' search:act_date='&gt;1517443200|&lt;1525132800'&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>I find <a href="https://www.unixtimestamp.com/">unixtimestamp.com</a> helpful to define timestamps, and I use ExpressionEngine template comments to remind myself of the human readable date.</p>

<p>And there you have it. Three simple but powerful filtering options now available in ExpressionEngine 4. We hope they help you solve challenges more easily than ever!</p>

<p>Sticky is perfect in this case, but previously you&#8217;d have to &#8220;cut&#8221; the listings using <code>limit=''</code>, which means placing that same limitation on your content authors. <code>limit='5'</code>, instruct them to just pick 5 stories, no more no less, and their &#8220;hot stories&#8221; are fine. But if they pick more than 5, then the excess won&#8217;t show up. If they pick fewer than 5, then normal stories get included with the &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.</p>

<p>With this new filter:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='news' sticky='only'&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now you can create a listing that <em>only</em> contains your must-read content, without setting limits on your content authors.</p>

<h2><code>search:numeric_field=''</code></h2>

<p>The last new unsung parametric hero of ExpressionEngine 4 is an update to the venerable <code>search:field=''</code> parameter. For numeric fields, you&#8217;ve always been able to use basic comparison operators. To show items that are $10 or less: <code>search:price='&lt;=10'</code>. ExpressionEngine 4 expands on this by allowing you to specify <em>ranges</em>.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;!-- show me Middle Schoolers --&#125;
&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='students' search:grade='&gt;5|&lt;9'&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now the filter will show all students from grades 6, 7, and 8.</p>

<p>This also works for <em>custom date fields</em>. Since date fields are stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>, you can perform numeric range checks just as easily.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;!-- show everyone who signed up to take their ACT from February through April 2018 --&#125;
&#123;exp:channel:entries channel='students' search:act_date='&gt;1517443200|&lt;1525132800'&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>I find <a href="https://www.unixtimestamp.com/">unixtimestamp.com</a> helpful to define timestamps, and I use ExpressionEngine template comments to remind myself of the human readable date.</p>

<p>And there you have it. Three simple but powerful filtering options now available in ExpressionEngine 4. We hope they help you solve challenges more easily than ever!</p>

				<p>Channels are a key component and arguably the main source of ExpressionEngine&#8217;s secret sauce. In version 4, the Channel Manager&#8217;s interface was redesigned to give site builders a smoother channel management workflow allowing them to tap into the true power, and flexibility of everyone&#8217;s favorite CMS.</p>

<p>Channels allow a site builder to create specific types of content containers, easily separating data into reusable chunks. For instance if you want to add a &#8220;blog&#8221; to your website, you can create a new Channel in ExpressionEngine to store the entries. This gives site builders a very flexible way to plan and manage their content, regardless of the project&#8217;s present or future needs.</p>

<p>In versions 1 through 3 the Channel Manager&#8217;s workflow was mostly unchanged. In order to add content to a Channel, you needed to define a custom field group, fill it with custom fields, and optionally a status and/or category groups and fill each with custom statuses and categories respectively. It was a lot of steps, and it required bouncing back and forth in different areas of the control panel. Worse yet, it was not intuitive at all, requiring knowledge of how Channels worked with other features, and what was required where. This lead site builders to come up with specific workflows to minimize the backtracking, but it was never ideal.</p>

<p>When we started planning version 4, I wanted to make sure that the Channel Manager got some love. On my wish list: a more intuitive workflow, unified forms, improved publish form layouts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, condensed status management, and the ability to reuse fields across Sites and Channels.</p>

<h2>Intuitive workflow</h2>

<p>This was a tough challenge. With ExpressionEngine, my work is constrained, not only by the medium, but also by ExpressionEngine&#8217;s history. I wanted to make sure that a process folks were familiar, even comfortable, with stayed familiar, but moved the needle forward, and improved the overall experience.</p>

<p>I decided to combine everything into a single workflow. One that you never had to leave to complete. A workflow that allowed you to click New Channel, and create the entire thing in order, in one fluid motion.</p>

<p>I tried a few different ideas, but ultimately landed on a tabbed form, with modals for creating the bits and bobs needed to make a Channel whole. I&#8217;ve found that almost always simple and straight forward is the best bet. So, while I explored other more complicated solutions, I always came back to the most obvious answer.</p>

<p>Today the path to making a Channel is Developer > Channels > New. Or, even faster, Developer > Channels > Import.</p>

<h2>Unified form</h2>

<p>In 4, I wanted to unify the forms so that all forms across the CP used the same styles, and concepts. In addition I wanted to unify the way we handled selection interfaces. I went about the heavy task of rethinking these items, and in version 4 I am happy to say a majority of the CP is <em>mostly</em> switched to these new patterns.</p>

<p>During this process I used a nine states paradigm, which allowed me to cover all possible states a field could appear in. It also allowed me to see exactly where certain patterns shared components, and where I needed to create new components.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://expressionengine.com/asset/img/blog/nine-states@2x.png" alt="Nine States of Design">
</figure>

<h2>Condensed status management</h2>

<p>My thought process was that since statuses aren&#8217;t used by other parts of the software, being exclusive to Channels, that they didn&#8217;t need groups, that the Channel itself was the group!</p>

<p>So in the UI, I removed groups, and I made it so if you don&#8217;t need any other statuses, you could just leave the default &#8220;Open&#8221; and &#8220;Closed&#8221; statuses and go about your day. And if you did <em>need</em> another status like &#8220;Draft&#8221;, you could create it, and again, just go about your day. In other Channels you&#8217;d have access to all your statuses. You could use &#8220;Draft&#8221; in four different Channels and never have to recreate it. Yay!</p>

<p>I thought I was a genius, and that I was solving all the problems!</p>

<p>However, this turned out to be the most unintentionally controversial decision I made during 4&#8217;s development. This seemingly innocuous change was a little deeper than I&#8217;d realized. Somehow status groups had their tiny tendrils wrapped around everything. We ended up exactly where I wanted with this feature. But I owe apologies to Kevin, and Low, two people I know this affected far more than I&#8217;d ever imagined.</p>

<h2>Reusable Fields</h2>

<p>I actually tried to get this into version 3. In fact late, late in version 3&#8217;s implementation I had to redesign the Channel, and Field Manager UIs to go back to the fields in groups paradigm. This time we freed the fields! Not unlike statuses my thought process was that we were putting folders into folders, when we didn&#8217;t need the extra set of folders.</p>

<p>I think we can all agree that having to create the same field multiple times in a single install is not super fun. The ability to use a smaller set of fields on a larger number of Channels, reduces your work load, and allows you to concentrate more on the fun stuff, than on the redundant minutiae.</p>

<p>Think about all the times you&#8217;ve typed <code>channel_seo_description</code> one for each Channel. Now, in 4 you only need one <code>seo_description</code> and you can assign it to all the Channels. 💥</p>

<p>With reusable fields, you can still use a field group to group fields that will be used together on multiple Channels. For instance, SEO fields. This is especially helpful if you want to support multiple social archetypes of meta data.</p>

<h2>That&#8217;s not all folks!</h2>

<p>The team and I are really happy with the final product, and it sounds like the changes we made to the Channel Manager are being well received and making folks happier, and more productive!</p>

<p>I like the idea of UI that adapts and changes over time, and I really like the idea of UI that gets better, without being noticed. In some cases though, rocking the boat and making a big change is the best way to go. I believe the Channel Manager was one of those cases.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope the new Channel Manager makes your next project smoother and helps get you to the fun stuff faster!</p>

<p>As always, my door is open for feedback james.mathias@ellislab.com. We won&#8217;t always agree, but I always listen, and try to consider all views.</p>

<p>Thanks for choosing ExpressionEngine, we really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Sure, emoji are 🔥 right now. Anytime a phone vendor adds or updates their emoji, it makes headlines. We all have friends (or are that person) that the new emoji are the compelling reason to upgrade. What&#8217;s the draw?</p>

<p>Humans have been been using ideograms for centuries, from heiroglyphs to modern city signs. Text based emoticons (smileys, like <code>:wink:</code> and <code>:stuck_out_tongue:</code>) surfaced in the early 80s as a useful way to add emotional context to online communication. Image-based emoticon popularity surged with internet forums. Emoji seem to bridge the gap between all three. They can add a simple straightfoward emotion, represent literal objects, or they can stand in for an abstract concept. They&#8217;re used by young and old, across all cultures, both formally and informally.</p>

<p>For example, for those who don&#8217;t want to know any of the technical details, we can flag that as skippable for them in this article with two emoji: 🤓🚨.</p>

<p>At first it may have felt like emoji may be a trend, a passing fad of youthful communication. But the solidification of over 2500 emoji into the Unicode standard means they are here to stay. They will certainly evolve along with language, but we are past the tipping point where it&#8217;s optional for a software developer to care. Especially one that focuses on empowering its customers to publish their universe, like us.</p>

<p>Since it meant increasing our system requirements, we couldn&#8217;t support emoji any sooner than our next major version. So, ExpressionEngine 4 brings official support for emoji.</p>

<p>🤓🚨: Emoji are represented by multi-byte characters, and MySQL was not able to store them properly until version 5.5.3. Specifically, a superset of <code>utf8</code> collation that uses up to four bytes to store each character—<code>utf8mb4</code>—is required. ExpressionEngine 4 increased the minimum MySQL requirement to 5.5.3 so it can use <code>utf8mb4</code> by default.</p>

<h2>Upgrading from earlier versions</h2>

<p>Converting a database to allow it to store emoji is <em>fairly</em> straightforward. But it sometimes needs some manual tweaking, <em>and</em> if you have a large database, it might take a very long time to complete the operation. So a v4 upgrade does <strong>not</strong> automatically convert your database. Instead we made a standalone utility that will perform the conversion for you. You can <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/Emoji-Support">download it here</a>, and run it whenever you&#8217;re ready.</p>

<p>On an average install, it will complete in seconds. On a ridiculously large test database, the backup and conversion took about 20-30 minutes total for us. If you&#8217;ve ever had to take your site offline to perform a MySQL <code>ALTER</code> command, then you know you fall into that latter camp. If you aren&#8217;t sighing and nodding your head knowingly at 👆, you will probably be able to run the conversion in seconds. The conversion tool will also warn you if there are third-party tables that require modifications before you can convert.</p>

<p>🤓🚨: Character limits in MySQL are expressed in terms of 3-byte characters. Because emoji take 4 bytes to store, table indexes that might contain them can only hold 191 characters instead of 255. ⌊255 * 3 / 4⌋ = 191. Maths, oy. The conversion utility will spell it out for you, and also help add-on developers be aware of what steps they need to take to support <code>utf8mb4</code>.</p>

<p>The conversion utility was made for ExpressionEngine 3 since it will mostly be used by folks who are upgrading. It will also work on v4 for those who have already upgraded. (Fun fact: it required no changes for v4 compatibility.) This means it can even enable your ExpressionEngine 3 installation to store emoji, addressing our all-time favorite bug report, titled: &#8220;<a href="https://expressionengine.com/support/bugs/21494/ee-cant-handle-the-poo-emoticon-and-many-others">EE can’t handle the Poo emoticon (and many others)</a>&#8221;. But until you upgrade to v4 you won&#8217;t have access to the coolest features:</p>

<h2>Emoji Shorthand Codes</h2>

<p>Storing emoji in the database properly is fine. But we also wanted to give content authors a simpler, more natural way to use emoji than having to open a character palette. So we decided to support emoji shorthand codes. If you&#8217;re a Slack or GitHub user, you are already familiar with them. You surround an emoji&#8217;s descriptive name with colons, and it renders the emoji. So I can type <code>:joy:</code> and display the most popular emoji of all, 😂. Or I can talk about how writing this blog post led me down a <code>:rabbit::hole:</code> (🐰🕳) of research on emoji usage, statistics, cultural differences, and even a <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/person-lotus-position/">podcast talking about the process of submitting and getting an emoji accepted into the Unicode canon</a>.</p>

<p>Any field that has formatting performed on it (Auto HTML, Markdown, etc.) will parse emoji shorthand automatically. Entries, comments, forum posts, wiki articles, add-ons, wherever. The source for short names comes from the <a href="https://unicodey.com/emoji-data/table.htm">Emoji Catalog</a>, and at times it is <em>slightly</em> behind Unicode. For instance, right now in iOS 11 there are some sweet new emoji like 🧗‍♀️, 🤮, 🤪, and 🥡. If you&#8217;ve been looking for them on Slack and missing them, this is why. We use the same datasource for shorthand, and it takes a little bit to update after new emoji are added to the lexicon.</p>

<h2>Emoji Template Tags</h2>

<p>Lastly we added an <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/add-ons/emoji/index.html">Emoji module</a> that gives you some template tags to work with emoji. You might build your own front-end emoji picker with the <code>&#123;exp:emoji:emoji_list&#125;</code> tag:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:emoji:emoji_list&#125;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;&lt;a href="#" onclick="addEmoji(':&#123;short_name&#125;:');"&gt;&#123;html_entity&#125;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&#123;/exp:emoji:emoji_list&#125;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or you might parse emoji shorthand codes from content sourced outside of ExpressionEngine with <code>&#123;exp:emoji:parse_shorthand&#125;</code>:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre><code>&#123;exp:emoji:parse_shorthand&#125;

<p>That&#8217;s right, ExpressionEngine finally has a one-click updater.</p>

<p>All 7,000+ lines of the new updater code were written wondering what it was going to be like to ship 4.0.1, our first in-app update. Well, it seems to have gone off without a hitch! We&#8217;ve since delivered hundreds of in-app updates with, as far as we know, a 100% success rate. But it wasn&#8217;t luck, it took much deliberation to achieve those stats.</p>

<p>When I was presented with the task of writing a one-click updater from scratch, it was daunting. In addition to the sheer technical challenge, it&#8217;s a feature that has the power to make sweeping changes to the file system and database. It&#8217;s an enormous responsibility, not only with a site&#8217;s data and uptime, but with our customers&#8217; trust. It has to work well.</p>

<p>The benefit of not being first to market with this feature is that there have already been many attempts to solve this problem. There are many documented cases of failed automated CMS updates out there on forums and Stack Overflow, we just had to go learn from them.</p>

<p>What became clear was that updating is scary, and that when an update blew up, the user was left with a feeling of helplessness, having to take to the internet while their site was down. So how do we (a) prevent things from blowing up in the first place? and (b) empower the customer to fix things on the off-chance that something does blow up?</p>

<p>Using this combination of empathy-driven and explosion-averse engineering, here are a few key decisions we made to make our updater one of the best.</p>

<h2>Use Resources Sparingly</h2>

<p>One of the most common complaints of in-app updaters is they run out of memory or exceed some time limit. So it was clear we needed to break up the large task of updating into small, bite(byte?)-sized chunks. Downloading is its own task, unpacking is its own task, verifying file integrity is its own task, and so on.</p>

<p>This presented a problem with database backups. For certain backwards-incompatible changes, we want to make database backups in case something happens and the update needs to be rolled back. But what if the data we need to back up is a bazillion gigabytes? We ended up creating a backup utility that could backup a database of any size on limited resources, provided you at least have the disk space. We did this by splitting the backup into small chunks per web request. This ended up working so well, even better than phpMyAdmin for large databases, that we made it available as a standalone utility in the control panel.</p>

<p>Another potentially resource-intensive task is updating ExpressionEngine&#8217;s files. Some updaters <em>copy</em> their new files into place, but users would report more failures if there were a lot of files to update, due to the increased time and memory usage. We solved this simply by <em>moving</em> files instead of copying. Moving files takes a fraction of the resources needed to copy, and since we only have to move the root folders, updating the files stays fast and lightweight no matter how many files need updating.</p>

<h2>Empower the Customer</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re all familiar with holding our breath before clicking that Update button. What if it fails? What state does that leave my site in? How do I roll back? Is my site going to be down until I get some help? Clicking Update should be exciting, not fill you with anxiety and uncertainty.</p>

<p>The updater was engineered from the beginning to catch as many preventable failures as possible and provide you with actionable steps to solve them. But if something unexpected happens, we offer a one-click rollback action that should put your install back exactly the way you had it. We achieve this through performing the actual upgrade through an independent micro-app that sits outside your ExpressionEngine install. This way, for example, if moving the new files into place fails and leaves some files updated and some not, we have a known good set of code we can run to set things straight again.</p>

<p>But what if even that fails? In that rare case, the customer should be able to get themselves up and running again with just a few steps and no feeling of helplessness. <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/installation/update.html#cannot-rollback-a-failed-upgrade">Move a few files around</a>, optionally import a database backup, and you are back in business. Plus you always have the option of performing a two-folder manual upgrade à la ExpressionEngine 3.</p>

<p>Not only do these steps keep the customer in control, but it reduces our support load. Having released a few updates to ExpressionEngine 4, so far we have not had one support request for a failed update. And over half of all v4 production sites are either on the latest patch release or only one patch release behind.</p>

<h2>Stay Secure</h2>

<p>Security is an important selling point of ExpressionEngine, and as you can expect, we&#8217;ve brought that same consideration to the updater. For instance, we&#8217;ve included a <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/installation/update.html#updating-via-command-line">command-line updater</a> if you prefer extra control over your file permissions. But there&#8217;s one more, big, security problem to solve.</p>

<p>The updater is essentially an automated process that downloads code from somewhere and then executes it on your server. What if that code isn&#8217;t ours? What if someone is able to fool ExpressionEngine into downloading and executing someone else&#8217;s code on your server?</p>

<p>We did a lot of research into the best practices for secure code delivery, and arrived at a cryptographic signing system so that ExpressionEngine knows it&#8217;s getting code from us and only us. Some popular PHP package delivery systems are behind in this area, and one popular CMS is <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39309">currently vulnerable</a> to one of the largest remote code execution attacks the world has ever seen. Sleep well tonight.</p>

<h2>Keep Calm and Update</h2>

<p>One of my favorite quotes is &#8220;make the right thing easy.&#8221; It can be applied to many facets of life, but is particularly useful in software design. Having the latest features, stability fixes, and security patches should be easy. We hope this feature goes a long way in reclaiming your valuable time and ultimately makes updating a delight.</p>

<p>This presented a problem with database backups. For certain backwards-incompatible changes, we want to make database backups in case something happens and the update needs to be rolled back. But what if the data we need to back up is a bazillion gigabytes? We ended up creating a backup utility that could backup a database of any size on limited resources, provided you at least have the disk space. We did this by splitting the backup into small chunks per web request. This ended up working so well, even better than phpMyAdmin for large databases, that we made it available as a standalone utility in the control panel.</p>

<p>Another potentially resource-intensive task is updating ExpressionEngine&#8217;s files. Some updaters <em>copy</em> their new files into place, but users would report more failures if there were a lot of files to update, due to the increased time and memory usage. We solved this simply by <em>moving</em> files instead of copying. Moving files takes a fraction of the resources needed to copy, and since we only have to move the root folders, updating the files stays fast and lightweight no matter how many files need updating.</p>

<h2>Empower the Customer</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re all familiar with holding our breath before clicking that Update button. What if it fails? What state does that leave my site in? How do I roll back? Is my site going to be down until I get some help? Clicking Update should be exciting, not fill you with anxiety and uncertainty.</p>

<p>The updater was engineered from the beginning to catch as many preventable failures as possible and provide you with actionable steps to solve them. But if something unexpected happens, we offer a one-click rollback action that should put your install back exactly the way you had it. We achieve this through performing the actual upgrade through an independent micro-app that sits outside your ExpressionEngine install. This way, for example, if moving the new files into place fails and leaves some files updated and some not, we have a known good set of code we can run to set things straight again.</p>

<p>But what if even that fails? In that rare case, the customer should be able to get themselves up and running again with just a few steps and no feeling of helplessness. <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/installation/update.html#cannot-rollback-a-failed-upgrade">Move a few files around</a>, optionally import a database backup, and you are back in business. Plus you always have the option of performing a two-folder manual upgrade à la ExpressionEngine 3.</p>

<p>Not only do these steps keep the customer in control, but it reduces our support load. Having released a few updates to ExpressionEngine 4, so far we have not had one support request for a failed update. And over half of all v4 production sites are either on the latest patch release or only one patch release behind.</p>

<h2>Stay Secure</h2>

<p>Security is an important selling point of ExpressionEngine, and as you can expect, we&#8217;ve brought that same consideration to the updater. For instance, we&#8217;ve included a <a href="https://docs.expressionengine.com/v4/installation/update.html#updating-via-command-line">command-line updater</a> if you prefer extra control over your file permissions. But there&#8217;s one more, big, security problem to solve.</p>

<p>The updater is essentially an automated process that downloads code from somewhere and then executes it on your server. What if that code isn&#8217;t ours? What if someone is able to fool ExpressionEngine into downloading and executing someone else&#8217;s code on your server?</p>

<p>We did a lot of research into the best practices for secure code delivery, and arrived at a cryptographic signing system so that ExpressionEngine knows it&#8217;s getting code from us and only us. Some popular PHP package delivery systems are behind in this area, and one popular CMS is <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39309">currently vulnerable</a> to one of the largest remote code execution attacks the world has ever seen. Sleep well tonight.</p>

<h2>Keep Calm and Update</h2>

<p>One of my favorite quotes is &#8220;make the right thing easy.&#8221; It can be applied to many facets of life, but is particularly useful in software design. Having the latest features, stability fixes, and security patches should be easy. We hope this feature goes a long way in reclaiming your valuable time and ultimately makes updating a delight.</p>
